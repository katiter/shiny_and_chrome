## The Census Data


With this simple Shiny application (http://katiter.shinyapps.io/project_prestige), we let the user explore the Canadian census data for occupations, available in the `car` package.

```{r}
Prestige <- car::Prestige
head(Prestige)
```
 

---
## Variables of Interest

The user can explore how these factors correlate with the perceived respectability of an occupation:

- Gender
- Education
- Salary

---

## A Sample Plot

For example, how does occupational prestige correlate with years of education? 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
require(ggplot2)
ggplot(Prestige, aes(education, prestige)) + geom_point() + theme_bw()
```

---

## Another Sample Plot
In the Shiny app, you can also explore by the percentage of women or by job type.


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
require(ggplot2)
ggplot(Prestige, aes(education, prestige)) + geom_point(aes(size=women, color=type)) + theme_bw()
```


---

## A Simple Model

After exploring the data through the app, we can build a simple model to describe occupational prestige.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
model <- lm(prestige ~ education + income, data=Prestige)
summary(model)
```
