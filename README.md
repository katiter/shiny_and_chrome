## App: Exploring job prestige


With this simple Shiny application at http://katiter.shinyapps.io/project_prestige, we let the user explore the Canadian census data for occupations, available in the `car` package.

The app allows the user to tweak a scatter plot in order to explore how these factors correlate with the perceived respectability of an occupation:

- Gender
- Education
- Salary
